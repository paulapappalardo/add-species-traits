# Add species traits

This repo includes functions to add species traits based on species names and higher taxonomy. For now, I am releasing the first version with a single function to add plankton groups. More functions to come!

## Add Plankton group

The first version of this function was published in Pappalardo et al, 2021:

Paula Pappalardo, Allen G Collins, Katrina M Pagenkopp Lohan, Kate M Hanson, Sarit B Truskey, William Jaeckle, Cheryl Lewis Ames, Jessica A Goodheart, Stephanie L Bush, Leann M Biancani, Ellen E Strong, Michael Vecchione, M G Harasewych, Karen Reed, Chan Lin, Elise C Hartil, Jessica Whelpley, Jamie Blumberg, Kenan Matterson, Niamh E Redmond, Allison Becker, Michael J Boyle & Karen J Osborn. The role of taxonomic expertise in interpretation of metabarcoding studies, ICES Journal of Marine Science, Volume 78, Issue 9, November 2021, Pages 3397â€“3410, https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsab082

The goal was to use broad taxonomic categories to separate plankton groups into holoplankton and meroplankton. It started with advice from Karen Osborn and Allen Collins from the NMNH Invertebrate Zoology Department, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution. Since then, Paula Pappalardo has been updating this function with further research, often searching specific species or smaller taxonomic groups and adding taxonomic levels as in NCBI or WoRMS taxonomy.

Paula has also used her life history database InvertTraits (unpublished - coming up soon) to improve the plankton groups classification. A publication and release for InvertTraits is in the making. You can check Paula's website for updates: https://paulapappalardo.weebly.com/.

If you have suggestions for improvement, please let Paula know.
